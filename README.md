### About Me
Hi Y'all! My name is Aurelia Mora Camacho (she/her/ella). I am a 2nd-year MURP concentrating in Transportation Policy and Planning. I was born and raised here in Los Angeles, and for the past 13 years, I have called Echo Park home. Through this program, I hope to continue exploring the different ways in which transportation developments impact and displace historically marginalized communities and advocate for planning processes that are truly participatory and equitable. I believe that _planning must come *from* community and be *for* community._ 
#### Interests and Hobbies 
* I am a *huge* Dodgers fan (the ~start of the post-season~ stress is real 😅) 
* Coffee is a staple in my everyday diet. Currently on a quest to find the best coffee shop around campus! (Any recommendations are appreciated 🙏🏽)
* I love me a good true-crime documentary or podcast

# Course Description: *Intro to GIS*
This course is intended to provide an introduction to analyzing and visualizing spatial data science, and the importance of being able to communicate data in a way that is more digestable for a broader audience and as a means to advancing research projects. 

# Project Ideas 💡
I am most interested in issues of transportation access, non-auto mobility, and housing affordability. More specifically, I am interested in researching the correlation between transportation developments, housing prices, and the displacement of predominantly Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities in Los Angeles. 
### Objectives 
These tools are _completely_ new to me. I want to be able to create data maps that support my research interests, and generally become more comfortable using tools that conduct spatial analysis that will allow me to create a more complete research narrative.
