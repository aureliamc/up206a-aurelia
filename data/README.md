# Purpose of Data
I believe that these datasets provide useful background information on mapping new affordable housing developments and where they are in relation to existing public transit lines. If used with LA County census demographic data, these datasets can be used to develop a visual for renters in LA County and transit ridership. More specifically, they can be used to visualize a map of where additional transit services may be needed and the ties transit has to access to housing.
